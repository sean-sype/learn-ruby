# Dev Containers
- to help keep my local clean, I am using the vscode plugin: Dev Containers. 
- I have a custom dockerfile, that uses a script from the library-scripts folder, then on launch will install the necessary files to the container on startup.
- all that is documented here: https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers/blob/600571bbfcac5631f45a7068b249350efa99ce21/script-library/docs/ruby.md
